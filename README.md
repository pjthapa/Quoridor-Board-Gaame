**LOGIC AND BOARD SETUP**
Quoridor is a two player board game with and 8x8 board and two board elemenets: a pawn and a wall. 
Each player has a pawn at their end of the board.
The goal of each player is to move the pawn to the opposite end of the board.
Each turn, the players can either move a pawn one square in any direction, or block the opponents pawn by placing a wall
A pawn can make a few other moves, such as diagonal if it is blocked by a wall, or the opponents pawn. 
Similarly, the pawn cannot be boxed in by walls, i.e there must be a path to the other end.
